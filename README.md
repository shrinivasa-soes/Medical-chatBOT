# **Medical Chatbot Project – AI-Powered Book-Based Assistant**  

## **Introduction**  
The idea behind this project was to develop an AI-powered **medical chatbot** that retrieves relevant information from a medical book or dataset. The chatbot was designed to assist users by providing **accurate, book-sourced responses** to their medical queries. Instead of generating generic AI responses, the bot would extract and return data directly from the book it was trained on.  

## **Why This Project?**  
1. **Reliable Medical Information** – Many chatbots provide AI-generated responses, which may not always be accurate. By using a **book-based approach**, the chatbot would ensure **factual and reliable** medical advice.  
2. **Quick Reference for Users** – Users can quickly search for medical conditions, symptoms, and treatments without having to manually scan through pages of medical books.  
3. **AI-Powered Assistance** – The chatbot could be useful for medical students, professionals, and even general users who need medical insights in a conversational manner.  

## **Challenges Faced**  
### **1. Pinecone Version Update Issue**  
- The chatbot was intended to use **Pinecone**, a vector database, to efficiently search and retrieve information from the book.  
- However, an **update in Pinecone's version** caused compatibility issues, which disrupted the project.  

### **2. API Authentication Error**  
- During implementation, an **authentication error** with the API prevented proper data indexing and retrieval.  
- Even after creating authentication credentials and trying different fixes, the issue remained unresolved.  

Since these technical problems halted the project, I was unable to complete it. Now, I am looking for ways to **resolve these issues** and continue building the chatbot.
